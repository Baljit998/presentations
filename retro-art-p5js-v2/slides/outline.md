## History of computer graphics

  - focusing on 1950s to 1980, before the widespread use of the personal computer

## Usage of computers
  - Graphics has roots in practical purposes
    - tasks that science and tech handed to computers require a graphic output of results
    - typewriters and printing machines were inadequate
    - this is why machines capable of graphic representation came to be developed
    - these instruments provided the impetus for computer graphics
      - but also not designed for aesthetic output
      - mostly line drawings and geometric shapes -- no color gradients shadings, color transitions

## Inputs
  - programmers rarely encounter the computer (Peripheral Vision, loc 493)
    - IBM 7090
      - 1959
    - IBM 1401 (https://www.wikiwand.com/en/IBM_1401)
