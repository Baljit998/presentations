## History of computer graphics
  ### Focus
  - focusing on 1950s to 1980, before the widespread use of the personal computer

  ### Usage of computers
    - Graphics has roots in practical purposes
      - typewriters and printing machines were inadequate
      - this is why machines capable of graphic representation came to be developed
      - these instruments provided the impetus for computer graphics
        - but also not designed for aesthetic output
        - mostly line drawings and geometric shapes -- no color gradients shadings, color transitions (Franke)
    - examples: computer drawings by William Fetter pg 255, Franke

## Inputs
  - programmers rarely encounter the computer (Peripheral Vision, loc 493)
    - IBM 7090
      - 1959
    - IBM 1401 (https://www.wikiwand.com/en/IBM_1401)
      - 1959 - 1971
      - translate cards to mag tape for the IBM 7090
      - can also output tape to punch cards
      - article on punch cards

    - 1964 - focus on IBM 360
    - IBM 1403 printer
  - punch tape, punch cards
  - storage
    - magnetic tape

## Value of aesthetics in generative art
  ### CTG of Japan
    - not about the final output, but about the algorithm(Reichdart)
  ### Art ex Machina review
    - by Stuart Preston, 1965 April 18

    Howard Wise Gallery exhibit by Michael A Noll and Bela Julesz (IBM 7094, SC-4020)
    "so far te means are of greater interest than the end, this revolutionary collaboration resulting in bleak, very comp,ex geometrical patterns excluding the smallest ingredient of manual sensibility."

    "no matter what the future holds -- and scientists predict a time when almost any kind of painting can be computer-generated -- the actual touch of the artist will no longer play any part in the making of a work of art.

    When that day comes the artist's role will consist of mathematically formularting, bu arranging an array of points in groups, a desired pattern. From then on all will be entrusted to the deus ex machina. Freed from the tedium of technique and the mechanics of picture making. the artist will simply 'create'"
      - AI work -- still derived from human inputs
