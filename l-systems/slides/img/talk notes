    - i like code. 
    - i also like art.
    - this talk is about combining the two of them

- 3m, what is generative art
    - art that is generated by a non-human, autonomous system that can independently decide the features of the artwork
    - art generated by algorithms

- let's talk about algorithms

- 4m, particle systems
    - individual particles follow a set of rules in relation to their neighbours
    - e.g. game of life
    - deterministic

- 4m, simple geometry
    - loops
    - constellations (some factor of particle systems)
        - element of randomness

- 5m, recursion
    - 2m, exsting fractals 
        - koch snowflake
        - serpinski's triangles
        - crystalline
    - 3m, l-systems 
        - system to describe recursive patterns
        - organic patterns
        - element of randomness

- 2m, closing
    - reiterate points
    - resources


Trees are recursive! (no, not those trees)
We'll explore L-systems, and how it can be used to generate beautiful, organic plants
