Abstract
Before personal computing became a thing, there was a handful of programmers and artists saw computers as a tool beyond their intended purpose: to create art.

In this talk, we will explore the early history of computer art, from ghostly oscilloscope paints to pre-ASCII text art. Weâ€™ll discuss how simple techniques with limited technology back then could yield compelling pieces. We'll see how the history of computer displays and printers have evolved in the 1950s to 1980s.


While quite a bit of retro art survives today, most of them do not come preserved with their algorithms. In this talk, I'll also demo some attempts to recreate retro art pieces using p5.js, a JavaScript graphics library as well as talk through some of the techniques of creating generative computer art.

Timeline
Timeline (tentative). It may vary in content but the structure would be similar. I will break down 3 different types of computer art starting from the 1950s to the 1980s and live demo some of the recreations done with JavaScript.

1 min: Speaker introduction

4 min: What is computer art?

8 min: Analog computer art in the 1950s -- Before digital computers, oscilloscopes were cool. Ben Laposky used the mathematical properties of oscilloscope waves to generate ghostly, ethereal shapes. Live demo recreation using JS.

8 min: History of ASCII art before ASCII -- Frederic Hammersley's text based art. How even the limited palette of the IBM mainframe text standard could yield interesting patterns. Live demo some ASCII art recreation.

8 min: Pre-printer era work -- how artists co-opted the plotter, originally intended for printing CAD schematics, to do creative work. We'll see Vera Molnar's algorithmic work, how they started off hand drawn to being computer drawn.
