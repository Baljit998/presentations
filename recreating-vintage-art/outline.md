- when viewed today, seems pretty magical or new
but plotters have had a long history in the era of computing

- lets first talk about what a plotter is
- mechanical plotters
- electronic/microfilm plotters
  - first film
  - but is another topic

- plotter art
  - collaboration between human, computer and plotter
  - added elements of the physical world

- limitations
  - line-based

- aesthetics
1. fractals
2. optical art
3. color and texture

- computing has only been around for about 70 years or so but we don't talk much about it. tech has been "cutting-edge" or "revolutionary" even up until today and i think that makes it hard to think of the fact that it is a field with rich history
